## 📋 Overview
NeonFlux is built from scratch using C++ and NEON intrinsics to maximize speed on Apple devices. It includes Python bindings that resemble PyTorch, allowing ease of use for those who are more comfortable in Python.

**Key Features:**
- High-performance linear algebra operations optimized for ARM64.
- Achieves less than 2ms latency for MLP inference.
- Outperforms traditional devices running PyTorch for small batch sizes.
- Easy installation with Python bindings for seamless integration.

## 🔧 System Requirements
To run NeonFlux, ensure your system meets these requirements:
- **Operating System:** macOS on ARM64 (Apple Silicon).
- **Required Libraries:**
  - C++ compiler that supports C++11 or newer.
  - Python (3.6 or later) for the bindings.
  - OpenMP support for parallel computation.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pybind11
```

These commands will download and set up libraries needed for the bindings.

### Step 6: Run the Application
Navigate to the folder where you extracted NeonFlux. You can either open the terminal in this folder or open your Python IDE and load the NeonFlux module. 

To run the example script, use:

```bash
python example.py
```

This will execute a test run to confirm everything is working perfectly.
